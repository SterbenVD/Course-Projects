## Topic: Implementation of ALTO assisted HTTP protocol in dynamic P2P systems

### Project Description

The project aims to implement ALTO assisted HTTP protocol in dynamic P2P systems. 
The project will be implemented in Python. 

### Project Requirements

The project will be emulated using [Mininet](http://mininet.org/).

### Project Deliverables

1. A report describing the project and its implementation.
2. Setup instructions for the project.
3. A presentation of the project.
4. The code for the project.

### References

Inspiration: We were thinking about parallelizing(with localization) blockchain ledgers, and eventually came about this protocol which helps in localization of data transfers in networks.
